Description:	Orientation baggage

Overview
	- TEST A LOT! I overlayed the skin and page information over the Dillsboro app to this build. I may have 
	  missed a few things that would make things quirky from admin to the interface itself. I hope I got 
	  everything but its unlikely.
	- App needs icons. I have a pack of icons that we can use but they must be entered staticly (without use
	  of the admin tools) so it could leave some open gaps down the road. This needs to be discussed with Dr.
	  Clapper.
	- We've tried to add transitions for the 'BLING' effect but the multipage jQuery Mobile approach has a lot
	  of quirks. I've read that it is possible to do this via AJAX, however, we have AJAX turned off at the 
	  top of all (or most) of the JS pages for reasons unknown to me. If you run out of things to do, look 
	  into this. It may turn out to be a fun project!
	- According to the jQuery Mobile Docs we aren't supposed to use document.Ready (or anything like it). 
	  There is a set method they suggest that I cannot think of at the time of writing this. It may be 
	  worthwhile to change to that method in order to ensure longterm stability of the app. As far as I can
	  see everything is working fine now but I've always been one to follow the books on things like that.
	- Docs folder is old and could stand to be cleaned out. Make sure to fill it with current information 
	  though.


Index page
	- Events button does not point to a page. Needs to be built using Google Calendar or RSS API possibly. 
	  Discuss this with Dr. Clapper (this feature has not been discussed with him previously). Creating a 	  	  calendar that only Tammy Haskett can change is also a possibility so that she can add her own events.
	- Weather button can stay or go. I don't think it would hurt to leave it, discuss with Dr. Clapper and
	  Tammy Haskett. It currently points to Local Yokel and opens in a new tab.
	- Parking is a possibility to add to the front page since it's not likely that we'll actually use the 
	  Google Maps API for directions. This should probably be static so, you may want to just delete it 
	  from the Admin Tools entirely. Definetly a problem that needs to be solved but I think the idea of 
	  using the PDF is the safest.
	- All maps need to be fixed for fit the screen properly. We've struggled to find a good fix for this. 
	  CSS Media Queries may be the answer.
	- All icons need to be recolored. I overlayed the Western Purple onto Dillsboro icons so some red is 
	  still showing through, especially in the transparent areas. They need to be redone from scratch.

POI Categories Page
	- Good for now I think.

POI_List Page
	- May not be a bad idea to seperate this from the map page to maintain consistency. Ask Dr. Clapper.

POI_List Map Page
	- Same as above. Seperate from list page.
	- Pop ups need redesign.
	- Icons need redesign.

POI page
	- I noticed some descriptions are showing the actual HTML tags instead of using them in the code. Hinds
	  University Center is a good example of this.
	- Format top picture for mobile page through CSS (I'll likely beat you to this).


About page
	- Needs to be updated for the current semester. Make sure to add yourself and anyone thats helped you 
	  along with QA. You're not getting paid for this (obviously) so make sure everyone gets credit for 
	  working on it. It may land you a job one day!
